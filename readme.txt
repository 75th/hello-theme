## Description

A plain-vanilla theme, best suited for building your site using **Elementor** & **Elementor Pro**.
This theme resets the environment and prepare it for smooth operation of Elementor.

Please note that we do not provide support for customizing the theme (as it should not be required, for customizing your site, use **Elementor!**).

2. Type in 'Elementor Hello' in the search form and hit the 'Enter' key on your keyboard.
3. Click on the 'Activate' button to use your new theme right away.
4. Navigate to Elementor and start building your site.

## Style

In order to change the styling used throughout the site, use **Elementor**.

However, if for some reason there is still a need to add or change the site's css, please take into account the following:
1. files located under 'reset' directory, should **NOT** be edited directly.
2. in order to change any of the values defined in preset/variables.scss, add your style code to custom/pre_default.scss.
3. any new scss files should be located under custom/ directory, and imported in custom/custom.scss.

## Frequently Asked Questions

* Does this theme support any plugins?

Elementor Hello includes support for WooCommerce.
